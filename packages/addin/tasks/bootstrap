// Bootstrap addins for vba-blocks build
// (necessary since addins are built with addins)
// 
// Manually perform the first few phases of the build process:
// 1. Create targets
// 2. Resolve src/dependencies/dev-dependencies to import
// 3. Import necessary files
//
// With the files imported, the build process will skip
// re-importing them (viewed as a rebuild)
// and the remaining build steps can be completed
